# WAVS Docs

Because WAVS is in rapid development, these docs will change throughout the course of building. Some pages are in-progress, and may reflect more of the desired shape of WAVS than current functionality. If you have any suggestions for these docs, or any notes on how to improve them, please reach out to Evan.

These docs were built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui).

## Build Locally

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Updating the theme

This site is built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui/theme), and a custom theme has been applied. To update the theme, you'll need to navigate to `tailwind.config.js`, and `global.css`. Styles are generated/applied by the tailwind config, which references the variables defined in the global CSS file.

Because the actual class names are generated by Fumadocs, you'll have to overwrite/"extend" the variables you want to change, and play around with what does what. They are loosely based on [shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming)'s theming, which may be a good reference.
