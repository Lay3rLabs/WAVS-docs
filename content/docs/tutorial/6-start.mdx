<Callout title="Docker for MacOS" type="warn">

Make sure that Docker is installed. If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure it is open and running.

Before proceeding, make sure that the following setting is updated:

**Enable Host Networking**: Open Docker and navigate to -> Settings -> Resources -> Network. Make sure that 'Enable Host Networking' is turned on.

Alternatively, you can install the following:

```bash
brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect && sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect
```

</Callout>


## Start Anvil, WAVS, and Deploy Eigenlayer

1. Create a `.env` file for your project by copying over the example with the following command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Use the following command to start an Anvil test chain and the WAVS runtime while deploying core EigenLayer contracts for your service:

```bash
make start-all
```

<Callout title="Keep WAVS running" type="info">

The `start-all` command must remain running in your terminal. Open another terminal to run other commands.

You can stop the services with `ctrl+c`. Some MacOS terminals require pressing this twice.

</Callout>
