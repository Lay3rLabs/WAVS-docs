## Build WASI component

Run the following command in your terminal to build your component.

```bash
make wasi-build
```

This command will build any components present in the `/components` directory, as well as auto-generate bindings and compile the components to WASM.

<Callout title="Build command" type="info">
You can also use the command below to build your solidity contracts and components in one command:

```bash
make build
```

</Callout>

## Execute WASI component directly

You can use the following command to execute the component using Cast. This command is handy for testing components without having to deploy WAVS.

```bash
make wasi-exec
```

Upon successful execution, you should receive a result similar to the following:

```bash
resp_data: Ok(PriceFeedData { symbol: "BTC", timestamp: "2025-02-14T01:23:03.963Z", price: 96761.74120116462 })
