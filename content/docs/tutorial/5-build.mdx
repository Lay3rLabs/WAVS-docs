<Callout title="Docker for MacOS" type="warn">

{/* This section is also in [](./2-setup.mdx). Remember to update there as well */}

Make sure that Docker is installed. If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure it is open and running.

Before proceeding, make sure that the following setting is updated:

**Enable Host Networking**: Open Docker and navigate to Settings -> Resources -> Network. Make sure that 'Enable Host Networking' is turned on.

Alternatively, you can install the following:

```bash
brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect && sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect
```

</Callout>

## Build WASI component

Run the following command in your terminal to build your component.

```bash
make wasi-build
```

This command will build any components present in the `/components` directory, as well as auto-generate bindings and compile the components to WASM.

<Callout title="Build command" type="info">
You can also use the command below to build your solidity contracts and components in one command:

```bash
make build
```

</Callout>

## Testing and debugging

You can use the following command to execute the component using Cast. This command is handy for testing components without having to deploy WAVS.

```bash
make wasi-exec
```

This command runs your component locally in a simulated environment and lets you easily view `print` statements for debugging. Running this command in the oracle example will print the information from the oracle [component code](./4-component#logging). Visit the [component walkthrough](./4-component#logging) for more information on logging during testing and production.


Upon successful execution, you should receive a result similar to the following:

```bash
resp_data: Ok(PriceFeedData { symbol: "BTC", timestamp: "2025-02-14T01:23:03.963Z", price: 96761.74120116462 })
 INFO Fuel used:
1477653

Result (hex encoded):
7b2273796d626f6c223a22425443222c2274696d657374616d70223a22323032352d30322d31345430313a32333a30332e3936335a222c227072696365223a39363736312e37343132303131363436327d

Result (utf8):
{"symbol":"BTC","timestamp":"2025-02-14T01:23:03.963Z","price":96761.74120116462}
```

<Callout title="Fuel" type="info">

In the output above, the `INFO Fuel used` value represents the computational power consumed during execution. Similar to how on-chain transactions have a gas limit to cap transaction costs, WAVS enforces a fuel limit to control off-chain computational workload and protect against DoS attacks.

The maximum fuel allocation can be adjusted in the `Makefile` to accommodate different processing needs.

</Callout>


## Custom triggers

When developing a custom trigger, you will need to update the template code in a few places:

1. The trigger contract itself in [`src/WavsTrigger.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/6fb281c9382ceefdc8538b7a8e29916c509aafc9/src/contracts/WavsTrigger.sol), which defines how triggers are created and emitted on-chain.
2. The `wasi-exec` command in the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/6fb281c9382ceefdc8538b7a8e29916c509aafc9/Makefile#L36-L40), which passes input data when testing WAVS components via `-input cast format-bytes32-string $(COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID)`. This simulates an Ethereum event during local execution.
3. The `decode_trigger_event` function in [`/components/eth-price-oracle/src/trigger.rs`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/6fb281c9382ceefdc8538b7a8e29916c509aafc9/components/eth-price-oracle/src/trigger.rs#L11-L21), which processes the trigger data and extracts relevant fields like `trigger_id` and `data`.
4. The `run` function in [`/components/eth-price-oracle/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/6fb281c9382ceefdc8538b7a8e29916c509aafc9/components/eth-price-oracle/src/lib.rs#L13), which calls decode_trigger_event, processes the extracted trigger data, and determines how to handle it.
5. The trigger script in [`/script/Trigger.s.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/6fb281c9382ceefdc8538b7a8e29916c509aafc9/script/Trigger.s.sol#L15), which calls the `addTrigger` function with the `coinMarketCapID`, used in this template for the oracle example.

##  Contract interfaces

You can view the code for the Solidity interfaces on the WAVS NPM package site: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wavs/solidity?activeTab=code
