## Build your component

Use the following command to build your component:

```bash
just wasi-build eth-trigger-reece-weather
```

## Test your component

The following commands will allow you to test your component by running it in a mock environment.

1. Export your [Open Weather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Make sure to add your OpenWeather API key to the command below.

```bash
export WAVS_ENGINE_ENV_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY="<your-key-here>"
```

2. The following command will simulate running just the component itself in the runtime with the input `Nashville,Tn`.

```bash
just cli-exec ./components/eth_trigger_reece_weather.wasm Nashville,TN
```
