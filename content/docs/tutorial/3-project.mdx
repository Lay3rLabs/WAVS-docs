## Clone WAVS

1. Clone the [WAVS repo](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/WAVS) and checkout the `reece/january-building-your-wavs` branch. You'll be building your project from this branch.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lay3rLabs/WAVS.git --branch reece/january-building-your-wavs
```

2. Enter the WAVS directory.

```bash
cd WAVS
```

## Modify `max_wasm_fuel`

Open `packages/wavs/wavs.toml` and modify the `max_wasm_fuel` to `100_000_000`

```toml
max_wasm_fuel = 100_000_000
```

## Environment setup

Use the following command to copy the `/env` files from the examples.

```bash
cp packages/cli/.env.example packages/cli/.env
cp packages/wavs/.env.example packages/wavs/.env
```

## Set up your project

1. Set up a new project by copying the `examples/eth-trigger-echo` example.

```bash
cp -r examples/eth-trigger-echo examples/eth-trigger-reece-weather
```

2. Update the paths in `cargo.toml`.

```bash
sed -i -e 's/eth-trigger-echo/eth-trigger-reece-weather/g' examples/eth-trigger-reece-weather/Cargo.toml
```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to open `examples/Cargo.toml` in VS Code.

```
code examples/Cargo.toml
```

4. Add your project to the workspace by pasting `"eth-trigger-reece-weather",` in the `[workspace] members` array.

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
  "btc-avg",
  "composition/http-allow-list/http-allowed-coingecko",
  "square",
  "permissions",
  "ai-bouncer",
  "eth-event-echo",
  "eth-trigger-echo",
  "eth-trigger-square",
  "eth-cosmos-query",
  "eth-trigger-reece-weather", # <- Add this one
]
```

## Update your project's Cargo.toml

The following steps all take place in the `examples/eth-trigger-reece-weather/Cargo.toml` file.

1. Open `examples/eth-trigger-reece-weather/Cargo.toml` and update `name=` under `[package]` to `"eth-trigger-reece-weather"`

```toml
[package]
name = "eth-trigger-reece-weather" # Update this line

```

2. Under `[dependencies]`, add the following:

```toml
[dependencies]
wit-bindgen-rt = { workspace = true, features = ["bitflags"] }
layer-wasi = { workspace = true } # Needed to interact with the WAVS runtime
serde = { workspace = true, features = ["derive"] } # for JSON conversion
serde_json = {workspace = true} # for JSON conversion
reqwest = {version = "0.12.12"} # Makes requests for you
```

3. Update the package name:

```toml
[package.metadata.component]
package = "component:eth-trigger-reece-weather" # Update this line
```
