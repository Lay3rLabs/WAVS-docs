## Create a Service Manager contract

The service manager validates, processes, and stores operator-submitted responses to on-chain triggers,

1. Copy the example Service Manager contract and name it `ReeceWeatherServiceManager.sol`.

```bash
cp contracts/LayerServiceManager.sol contracts/ReeceWeatherServiceManager.sol
```

2.  Rename the contract and its internal references:

```bash
sed -i -e 's/contract LayerServiceManager/contract ReeceWeatherServiceManager/g' contracts/ReeceWeatherServiceManager.sol
sed -i -e 's/LayerServiceManager(/ReeceWeatherServiceManager(/g' contracts/ReeceWeatherServiceManager.sol
```

## Create the deploy script

1. Copy the deploy script, which will deploy the contracts with Forge and link it to EigenLayer's core AVS staking and delegation infrastructure.

```bash
cp contracts/script/LayerServiceManager.s.sol contracts/script/ReeceWeatherServiceManager.s.sol
```

2. Replace `LayerServiceManager` with your new contract.

```bash
sed -i -e 's/LayerServiceManager/ReeceWeatherServiceManager/g' contracts/script/ReeceWeatherServiceManager.s.sol
```
