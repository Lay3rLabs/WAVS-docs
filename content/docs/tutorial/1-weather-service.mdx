This guide will walk you through the steps of creating, testing, and running a service using WAVS.

For this tutorial, you'll be building a simple weather service that takes a city and state as an onchain input, fetches weather data offchain, and submits a response onchain of the weather data of the specified location.

1. An onchain trigger with a location (`Winston-salem,NC` for example) is emitted.

2. Operators running the weather service listen for the event, and fetch the weather data from the specified location. in the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

3. Operators receive the result from the weather API and return it onchain as a signed payload.
