Below is a list of WAVS key terms and their definitions.

## AVS (Actively Validated Service)

AVSs (Actively Validated Services) are computational services that are run offchain which can be verified onchain. Services are run by operators that can listen for onchain events to trigger an offchain task. Operators run the task, come to a consensus, and submit the result onchain in a verifiable way.

## Service component

Service components are the core logic of a service. They can be written in Rust (with support for more languages coming soon) and are compiled to WASM. 
When a service is triggered, an operator will run the corresponding service component in the WAVS runtime. Service components can also be referred to as WASI components.

## Service manifest (WIP)

A service manifest defines all of the components of an individual AVS. The manifest is a JSON file that contains all of the necessary information on the different parts that make up a specific service, including the trigger, service component, service id, and 

## Aggregator

An aggregator is an offchain component used to conserve gas fees for result submissions on Ethereum. Instead of each individual operator submitting results of a service directly onchain (which would be costly), operators sign the results and submit them offchain to an aggregator, which aggregates the results and submits a result to be posted to the chain in a single transaction. Results are signed using an operator's individual private key to produce an ECDSA signature, which is used to prove that the result is associated with an operator's specific private and public key pair. The aggregator accepts the result submissions from operators, verifies their validity, and compares the responses. If their is a consensus among operators on a single result, it is submitted onchain as a single transaction. This method ensures that results are verifiably accurate while saving on transaction costs. Aggregation is an optional feature that can be defined in a service.

## Workflow

A workflow is comprised of a specific trigger and a specific service component pair. Operators listen for triggers, and run the associated service component in the workflow.

## Trigger

A trigger is an onchain event that prompts the running of a service component by an operator. Triggers are specified by an AVS as part of a workflow. Operators listen for events specified by the trigger and run the associated service component in WAVS.

## Trigger manager

The trigger manager is a contract in charge of storing all of the different triggers specified by AVSs.

## WASI

WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) is a standardized API that enables WASM (WebAssembly) modules to interact with a host system in a secure and platform-independent way. It provides Wasm modules with a standardized set of APIs to access system resources like files, clocks, and network sockets. for more information, visit the [WASI documentation](https://wasi.dev/).

## WASI Component

See [service component](#service-component).

## WASM

Web Assembly (WASM) is a high-performance, low-level binary format that can be compiled from code written in a variety of languages. It provides a secure, sandboxed environment, ensuring safe execution by isolating code from the host system. WASM can even be run in web browsers at near-native speed.
