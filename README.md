# WAVS Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for WAVS, a WASI AVS runtime for streamlined AVS development.

Live site: https://docs.wavs.xyz/

## Build Locally

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Link Checking

To check for broken links in the documentation:

```
npm run check-links
```

This command will:
1. Kill any existing server on port 3000
2. Start a new dev server
3. Check all internal links
4. Kill the server when done

The link checker is also integrated into the build process (`npm run build`), ensuring no broken links make it to production.

These docs were created using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui).

## Updating the theme

This site is built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui/theme). To update the theme, navigate to `tailwind.config.js`, and `global.css`. Styles are generated/applied by the tailwind config, which references the variables defined in the global CSS file.

Because the actual class names are generated by Fumadocs, you'll have to overwrite/"extend" the variables you want to change, and play around with what does what. They are loosely based on [shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming)'s theming, which may be a good reference.
